secauth is a protocol for authentication.

It is not a secure alternative to encrypted
communcation, nor is it a password hashing algorithm,
but is used between the two.

If used correctly, secauth ensures the server owner,
or someone with access to the server, does not get
access to the user's plain-text password. It also
gives the user a lower bound for the security with
which the server is treating the password.

Additionally, if an attacker breaks the communication
encryption, he will not access to the user's plain-text
password and the information he gets access to is not
reusable.
